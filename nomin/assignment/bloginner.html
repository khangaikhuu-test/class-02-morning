            <p>Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are unsure about
                how to
                get the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to build a
                Figma
                plugin for the larger design community. The plugin is called the Ghost UXWriter and has a set of
                UX
                copies cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone variation ranging from plain, casual to
                playful. The intention to build this Figma plugin originated from our Medium blog post,
                ‘Designing
                voice and tone for error messages.</p>
